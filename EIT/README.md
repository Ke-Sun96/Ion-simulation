EIT cooling is a promising technique used to cool atoms or ions to extremely low temperatures. In EIT cooling, a coupling laser and a probe laser are applied to a quantum system, typically a cloud of atoms or ions. The coupling laser is tuned to a frequency such that it induces transparency for the probe laser within a narrow spectral window.

When the coupling laser and probe laser are simultaneously applied, the atoms or ions exhibit a unique behavior. The coupling laser manipulates the atomic or ionic energy levels, creating a "dark state" for the carrier and blue sideband transitions, while keeping a strong coupling strength for the red sideband transitions. Consequently, the atoms or ions experience a cooling effect due to the reduction of the phonons when the red sideband transition is driven.

EIT cooling offers several advantages over traditional laser cooling methods. In contrast to Doppler cooling, it can efficiently cool ions to nearly the motional ground state, resulting in a final temperature much lower than the Doppler cooling limit. Additionally, in comparison to resolved sideband cooling, EIT cooling can simultaneously cool multiple modes across a relatively broad spectrum, thereby accelerating the cooling process.
